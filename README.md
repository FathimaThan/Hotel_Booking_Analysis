## Overview:
This project draws inspiration from a tutorial video by [codebasics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh9nVJoWXmFb7sLApWGcLPQ) titled 'End-to-End Data Analytics Project'. In the tutorial, Dhaval Patel provides a comprehensive guide on conducting data analysis using Power BI.

## Motivation:

Upon watching the tutorial, I gained insights into data visualization techniques, data cleaning methodologies, and dashboard creation using Power BI. Applying these learnings, I embarked on a project to analyze sales data from a retail company. By importing, cleansing, and visualizing the data using Power BI, I was able to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights that informed strategic business decisions for the company.
